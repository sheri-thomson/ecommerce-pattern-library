      <p class="milli">Lemongrass, also referred to as Cymbopogon flexuosus,  is native to tropical regions such as Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Oceania where it has been used traditionally for medicinal, cosmetic and culinary purposes. In countries such as India, China, and Thailand, it has been used as a flavouring agent in beverages, desserts, and other culinary preparations for its ability to promote better digestion, boost circulation and immunity, treat infections, and relieve irregularities in menstrual cycles. Due to its ability to reduce fever, Lemongrass earned the name “fever grass” in some cultures.</p>
